Overview
This project aims to classify individuals into two categories: those who have heart disease and those who do not, based on various health metrics and demographic data. The classification is performed using various machine learning algorithms.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, It contains the following features:

Age: Age of the patient
Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
CP: Chest pain type (4 values)
Trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
Chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
FBS: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
Restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
Thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
Exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
Thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect
Target: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = disease; 0 = no disease)

Results
The following machine learning algorithms were tested:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines
Neural Networks
The best performing model was [Model Name], which achieved an accuracy of [X]%.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques to classify heart disease. The results show that [Model Name] performed the best, indicating its suitability for this type of classification task.

Future improvements could include:

Using more advanced techniques such as ensemble learning and hyperparameter tuning.
Incorporating additional features to improve model accuracy.
Deploying the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
